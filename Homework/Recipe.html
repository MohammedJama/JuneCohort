            <h1> Lotus Cheesecake Recipe</h1>  

            <p>Here is what you need to make the perfect lotus cheesecake.</p>
            
            <h3> Ingredients</h3>

               <h5>Biscuit Base</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>300g Lotus/Biscoff biscuits</li>
                        <li>125g unsalted butter (melted)</li>
                    </ul>
               <h5> Cheesecake Filling</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>500 g cream cheese (full fat)</li>
                        <li>100 g icing sugar</li>
                        <li>250 g Biscoff spread (smooth/crunchy)</li>
                        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>300 ml double cream</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Blitz the biscuits for the base in a food processor until they're a fine crumb. <br> Mix with the melted butter and press down firmly into an 8"/20cm deep <br> springform tin.</li>
                        <li> With an electric mixer (I use my KitchenAid) mix the cream cheese, vanilla, <br> icing sugar and Biscoff spread until smooth.</li>
                        <li> Mix in the double cream and whisk until its thick and holds itself <br> completely! (Don't whip it too fast, slow and steady wins the race). <br> Alternatively, you can whip the cream separately to stiff peaks and fold <br> through!</li>
                        <li> Spread the mixture evenly over the biscuit base and chill in the fridge for at <br> least 5-6 hours, but preferably overnight.</li>
                        <li> Remove from the tin and decorate how you like. </li>
                    </ol>
